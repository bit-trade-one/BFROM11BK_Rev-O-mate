  Summary:
    This file contains all of functions, macros, definitions, variables,
    datatypes, etc. that are required for usage with the HID function
    driver. This file should be included in projects that use the HID
    \function driver.  This file should also be included into the 
    usb_descriptors.c file and any other user file that requires access to the
    HID interface.
    
    
    
    This file is located in the "\<Install Directory\>\\Microchip\\Include\\USB"
    directory.

  Description:
    USB HID Function Driver File
    
    This file contains all of functions, macros, definitions, variables,
    datatypes, etc. that are required for usage with the HID function
    driver. This file should be included in projects that use the HID
    \function driver.  This file should also be included into the 
    usb_descriptors.c file and any other user file that requires access to the
    HID interface.
    
    This file is located in the "\<Install Directory\>\\Microchip\\Include\\USB"
    directory.
    
    When including this file in a new project, this file can either be
    referenced from the directory in which it was installed or copied
    directly into the user application folder. If the first method is
    chosen to keep the file located in the folder in which it is installed
    then include paths need to be added so that the library and the
    application both know where to reference each others files. If the
    application folder is located in the same folder as the Microchip
    folder (like the current demo folders), then the following include
    paths need to be added to the application's project:
    
    ..\\..\\Microchip\\Include
    .
    
    If a different directory structure is used, modify the paths as
    required. An example using absolute paths instead of relative paths
    would be the following:
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\Microchip\\Include
    
    C:\\Microchip Solutions\\My Demo Application

/********************************************************************
	Function:
		void USBCheckHIDRequest(void)

 	Summary:
 		This routine handles HID specific request that happen on EP0.
        This function should be called from the USBCBCheckOtherReq() call back
        function whenever implementing a HID device.

 	Description:
 		This routine handles HID specific request that happen on EP0.  These
        include, but are not limited to, requests for the HID report
        descriptors.  This function should be called from the
        USBCBCheckOtherReq() call back function whenever using an HID device.

        Typical Usage:
        <code>
        void USBCBCheckOtherReq(void)
        {
            //Since the stack didn't handle the request I need to check
            //  my class drivers to see if it is for them
            USBCheckHIDRequest();
        }
        </code>

/********************************************************************
    Function:
        BOOL HIDTxHandleBusy(USB_HANDLE handle)
        
    Summary:
        Retreives the status of the buffer ownership

    Description:
        Retreives the status of the buffer ownership.  This function will
        indicate if the previous transfer is complete or not.
        
        This function will take the input handle (pointer to a BDT entry) and 
        will check the UOWN bit.  If the UOWN bit is set then that indicates 
        that the transfer is not complete and the USB module still owns the data
        memory.  If the UOWN bit is clear that means that the transfer is 
        complete and that the CPU now owns the data memory.  

        For more information about the BDT, please refer to the appropriate 
        datasheet for the device in use.
        
        Typical Usage:
        <code>
        //make sure that the last transfer isn't busy by checking the handle
        if(!HIDTxHandleBusy(USBInHandle))
        {
            //Send the data contained in the ToSendDataBuffer[] array out on
            //  endpoint HID_EP
            USBInHandle = HIDTxPacket(HID_EP,(BYTE*)&ToSendDataBuffer[0],sizeof(ToSendDataBuffer));
        }
        </code>

    PreCondition:
        None.
        
    Parameters:
        USB_HANDLE handle - the handle for the transfer in question.
        The handle is returned by the HIDTxPacket() and HIDRxPacket()
        functions.  Please insure that USB_HANDLE objects are initialized
        to NULL.
        
    Return Values:
        TRUE - the HID handle is still busy
        FALSE - the HID handle is not busy and is ready to send
                additional data.
